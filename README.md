# Pickaxe
A "swiss-knife" tool for the Carbon Language

## Goals:
- Have an entire environment that can help you get started and work with Carbon from beginning to end, no matter the experience you have, that includes from installing to compiling Carbon projects.
- Port this program slowly to pure Carbon once the language itself is ready.

## Warning for programmers:
A chunk of code is part of the [Geometria Engine](https://github.com/Geometria-Engine) an engine that i (NachoBIT) have been working on for the past 3 years now.

Some parts have been changed to adapt to Pickaxe's environment instead of Geometria's, but that part got a bit dirty, so be careful.

## Start coding:

- Windows:
  - Download the **Visual Studio Build Tools** Installer and open it
  - Select the **Desktop C++ environment** (this process, depending of how it goes, can be automated by the binary in the future).
  - Once you finish installing the tools you need, download/clone this repository.
  - Go to the root folder and open **Pickaxe.exe**.
  - Run the "--compile-itself" command to compile the program.
    - The final output will be created on the "Pickaxe" folder.

- Linux:
  - Coming Soonâ„¢.
